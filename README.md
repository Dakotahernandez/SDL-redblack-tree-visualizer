# SDL-RedBlack-Tree-Visualizer

## Goal
The goal of this project is to implement a Red-Black Tree data structure and visualize its operations using the `SDL_Plotter` class. The primary objectives are:

- To understand the properties of Red-Black Trees.
- Implement insertion, deletion, and rebalancing operations.
- Create a visual representation of the tree using `SDL_Plotter`.

## To do list 
1)get sdl working on everything on everyones computers 
2)understand redblack trees
3)build working redblack tree
4)have sdl screen recieve data that effects red black tree
5)have sdl display trew

Requirements

SDL2
SDL_MIXER

##### How to add and set up SDL2 and SDL_Mixer on xcode on mac
1)if you dont have homebrew download in your terminal using the following command <br />
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
2)download SDL2 and the mixer in your terminal using homebrew use the following command
brew install sdl2 sdl2_mixer
3)Create a new xcode project:set as a command line tool using c++
4) Link SDL2 and SDL2_mixer Binary Libraries in Xcode
You need to link the SDL2 and SDL2_mixer binary libraries to your Xcode project.
In Xcode, select your project from the Project Navigator (left panel).
Under Targets, select your project target (usually the same name as your project).
Go to the Build Phases tab.
In the Link Binary With Libraries section, click the + button.
Choose Add Other
once the tab comes up use the keybind command + shift + G
then search /opt/homebrew/lib 
Add libSDL2.dylib and libSDL2_mixer.dylib to your project(it will say open instead of add but it will add)
5)Set Up Header Search Paths
Select your project in the Project Navigator (left-hand side).
Go to the Build Settings tab.
In the search bar, type Header Search Paths.
Double-click on Header Search Paths and add the following paths:
For SDL2: /opt/homebrew/include 
For SDL2_mixer: /opt/homebrew/include/SDL2
leave both as non recursive
6)Set Up Library Search Paths
In Build Settings, search for Library Search Paths.
Double-click Library Search Paths and add 
For SDL2: /opt/homebrew/include 
For SDL2_mixer: /opt/homebrew/include/SDL2
non recursive again
7)finally theres been a recent update to the SDL libraies so their signauture is diffrent
and flagged by apple security so you must turn off signature checking 
Select your project in the Project Navigator (the left panel).
Go to the "Signing & Capabilities" Tab:
Add the "Disable Library Validation" Entitlement:
Scroll down to see if the "App Sandbox" capability is enabled. If not, add it by clicking the + button in the upper-left corner and selecting App Sandbox.
Once App Sandbox is added, click on it to expand the entitlement options.
Under Security, youâ€™ll find the Disable Library Validation option.
Enable it by checking the box next to Disable Library Validation.

the SDL is now properlly connected
now clean your build (shift + command + k)
try and build (shift + command + b)it before running to try and make sure there are no error
if it builds safely run it(command + r)
additional notes 
if you cant find your paths for the search paths you can search for your search paths in your console with 
find / -name "SDL2" 2>/dev/null
