Performance Analysis (15%): Thorough analysis of performance under different scenarios.
Provide a detailed report that includes:
Explanation of how the Red-Black Tree works.
Design decisions in implementing the tree and visualization.
Description of the interface and how it supports user interaction.
Performance analysis with the chosen datasets.
Reflections on the challenges encountered and how they were resolved.
Test your Red-Black Tree with at least three datasets:
Randomly generated integers.
A dataset of increasing order.
A dataset of decreasing order.
Analyze the performance in terms of:
Height of the tree.
Average and worst-case time complexity for insertions and deletions.
Number of rotations and re-colorings.
